# Blog Post 2: **Stars in Our Galaxy**
<h2> Our Galactic Canvas in the Sky</h2>
<p> As we look into the night sky on a clear night, it is easy to see the emerging constellations with a deep-rooted history on our planet. The stars have inspired legends and myths throughout many cultures. For example, the Orion constellation, showing the distinctive belt and sword, has become a canvas for the tales of gods and heroes throughout various histories. The stars in our sky have the purposes of both a cultural canvas and transcending geographical boundaries. The light these stars give off offers a window into the past without anyone even knowing it! The same stars we may see today may have been emitting their light for thousands of years. </p>
<p> By studying the stars, or as I like to call them, "Cosmic time capsules," present-day astronomers are able to make inferences and unravel the history of our galaxy. As the sun sets, the night sky slowly turns into a living museum, telling the story of the evolution of our home! As we gaze upon the stars that are all across the canvas in the sky, we must look at them not only as stars but also as the storytellers and narrators of our galaxy. So, we must embrace the magic of gazing upon the stars and honor the stories they can tell throughout the Milky Way. </p>
