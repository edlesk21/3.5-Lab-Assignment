# Blog Post 2: **Stars in Our Galaxy**
<h2> Our Galactic Canvas in the Sky</h2>
<p> As we look into the night sky on a clear night, it is easy to see the emerging constellations with a deep-rooted history on our planet. The stars have inspired legends and myths throughout many cultures. For example, the Orion constellation, showing the distinctive belt and sword, has become a canvas for the tales of gods and heroes throughout various histories. The stars in our sky have the purposes of both a cultural canvas and transcending geographical boundaries. The light these stars give off offers a window into the past without anyone even knowing it! The same stars we may see today may have been emitting their light for thousands of years. </p>
